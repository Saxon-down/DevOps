A Jira+Confluence+Jenkins setup with backend PostgreSQL databases, all
hidden behind an NGINX reverse-proxy.

To use, run "python3 initialise.py UP" - this will create all required folders,
DNS entries (in /etc/hosts) and spin up docker. Alternatively
run "python initialise.py DOWN" to tear it all down again (WARNING: this
destroys any persistent data)

If for some reason you need to modify the hostnames*, make sure you update:
- in docker-compose.yml, both the hostname and container name for each
  service you're renaming
- in nginx.conf, the server_name for each service you're renaming
- in /etc/hosts, the hostname for each service you're renaming

.. you shouldn't need to rename anything else.



* Only relevant for the server services for Jira, Jenkins & Confluence

A Jira+Confluence+Jenkins setup with backend PostgreSQL databases, all
hidden behind an NGINX reverse-proxy.

REQUIRED: Docker must be installed correctly
          python must be installed (works with v2.7 and v3.x)
          initialise.py requires UNIX-based OS

To use, run "python initialise.py UP" - this will set up the required
subdirectories, add the relevant entries to your /etc/hosts file and 
spin up the docker containers.

You can also run "python initialise.py DOWN" to clean everything up 
again (remove the subfolders, remove entries from /etc/hosts, shut down
    the containers).

If for some reason you need to modify the hostnames*, make sure you update:
- in docker-compose.yml, both the hostname and container name for each
  service you're renaming
- in nginx.conf, the server_name for each service you're renaming
- in /etc/hosts, the hostname for each service you're renaming

.. you shouldn't need to rename anything else.



* Only relevant for the server services for Jira, Jenkins & Confluence

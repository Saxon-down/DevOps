A script I've written for migrating data from one elasticsearch instance
to another. It can also be used to migrate data to a new INDEX or TYPE
(/INDEX/TYPE/record_id as of elasticsearch v6.5) within the same instance.

Files:
- elastic-migrator.py	: the main script
- migratorcfg.py	    : several functions I use with other ELASTIC scripts
- elastic-migrator.cfg	: config file in basic JSON format

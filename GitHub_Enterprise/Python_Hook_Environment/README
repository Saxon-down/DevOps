A simple dockerfile and bash script for creating a Python
hook environment for GitHub Enterprise.

I'm using this to run a pre-receive hook which requires SSL certificates, so
they need to either be generatedi/downloaded (PEM file includes both 
certificate and private key) or commented out in the dockerfile.

My instance also requires specific python libraries, included in the 
requirements.txt file
